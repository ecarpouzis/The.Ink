The compiled/built verison of the game handles the Menu pause differently than when running the game from the development platform. This is expected, somewhat, but not in every case.

While play testing this morning I discovered the following bugs/issues:

- Character is not colliding properly against ShortPlatform assests 100% of the time
- The Controller does not use the same illumination effect as mouse over, which could be confusing to some players
- The Controller illumination, in some instances, did not work at all
 (when paused while dead and rewinding behaved differently than while paused but not rewinding)
- Immediately after pause, the input for "Jump" is respected
- Alternate Key for "Menu" should be set to Escape
- DPad is not usable at all
